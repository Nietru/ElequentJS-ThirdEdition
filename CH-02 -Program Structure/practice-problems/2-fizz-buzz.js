// Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1-100, with two exceptions. Page 37:
// For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
// For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
// When you have that working, modify your program to print "Fizzbuzz" if divisible by 3 and 5.
